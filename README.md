# FinalProject

An AWS user account was provided by the company where I currently work CGI OY, the I proceed to create an Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) cluster using the following steps and requirements:
1.	Creation of S3 bucket. S3 buckets are defined as Simple Storage Service; this service provides scalability, high availability and low latency with extreme high durability. This service is organized by the creation of individual buckets where the data is stored.
The steps are going into service dashboard and under the section Storage, click on S3. Then the next step is to create, name of the bucket, select the region and then access permissions. I restrict the access of the bucket to the creator or user (myself). Finally, I uploaded two files,  bootstrap.sh file contains the data to be used.
